---------------------Spring and spring boot---------------------

difference between IOc and DI
when you can use constructor injection and when you can use setter injection.
@primary annotation
‌scope of bean , by default scope
-----------------------------------
@service Vs @component
@Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring managed component.
@Component – Indicates a auto scan component.
@Repository – Indicates DAO component in the persistence layer.
@Service – Indicates a Service component in the business layer.
@Controller – Indicates a controller component in the presentation layer

We can directly use @Component for each and every bean, but for better understanding and maintainability of a large application, we use @Controller, @Service, @Repository
Spring only pick up and registers beans with @Component  and doesn't look for @Service and @Repository in general.

They are registered in ApplicationContext because they themselves are annotated with @Component:

@Component
public @interface Service {
}
@Component
public @interface Repository {
}

@Service and @Repository are special cases of @Component. They are technically the same but we use them for the different purposes.

------------------------------
conponentScan vs component 
Define @ComponentScan(“com.in28minutes.springboot”) 
This would scan the entire parent tree of com.in28minutes.springboot.
Or define two specific Component Scans by using an array. 
@ComponentScan({“com.in28minutes.springboot.basics.springbootin10steps”,”com.in28minutes.springboot.somethingelse”})
@Component indicates that a class might be a candidate for creating a bean. It's like putting a hand up.
@ComponentScan is searching packages for Components. Trying to find out who all put their hands up.

@ComponentScan scans all the class files specified under the base package i.e. search for the files under this package for any annoted java files with @Component, @Repository, @Service and @Controller and if it finds any of them it will register it into the bean factory.
